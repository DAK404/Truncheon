Script files are integrated. Grinch Script Files and the Nion Shell files are now integrated into a single file.

Any file that contains a script to the grinch code, it passes on the file line number to the script engine found inside Grinch
The script engine would then navigate to that line and begin reading from that line in the script file.

<END SCRIPT> will stop executing the script, will only work in the script engine found in the Kernel
<END GRINCH> will stop executing a grinch script and return to the kernel and continue executing the script file
