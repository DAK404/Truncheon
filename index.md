| Feature Name | Details |
| --- | --- |
|**Unified Build System** | This program has all the core code written purely in Java, which means that the same program build can run on Windows&reg;, MacOS&reg; and Linux with ease! With minimal dependency on external code and programs, this program will run on any system that Java is supported on! |
|**Truncheon Kernel** | With the ideas taken in from Mosaic and (the now cancelled Lamatshu), the program has an advanced kernel and core programs which is simple, modular and efficient.Truncheon has its own API to allow people to build programs on top of Truncheon itself! |
|**Dragon API** | APIs related to login and user management system with advanced security features, which can be harnessed by other softwares built on Truncheon. **Stored credentials are not stored in plain text format, which means that the database will be secure against attacks.**|
|**OTA Updates** | This program can receive OTA updates directly from the web over time, including security enhancements and optimizations. The update package is minimally small in size (roughly less than 8 MB), will take less than 2 minutes to install the update. Its all upto the user then: Restart the program right away, else finish the work and then restart/exit. On the next boot, the updated program will be loaded, giving the best experience to the user, always. |
|**Nion Script Engine**| Utilizes a script engine to run various script files to easily run commands at a bulk! Script documentation is [available here](https://dak404.github.io/Truncheon/Readme.html#nion-script-language)! |
|**Useful Features**| Uses the built in APIs to provide a set of powerful and versatile features to work with, right out of the box. Extra programs can be loaded/downloaded from the internet to enhance the experience and the features offered, but note that not all programs downloaded from the internet (which has not been open sourced) cannot be trusted implicitly as they might be malicious in nature.
|**Program Toolsets**| Truncheon Source code includes tools which will help in compiling the program, documentation and the Launcher, and then running, and debugging it! Although the debugger will not be included, people can write their own Debugger to fulfil the requirements!
