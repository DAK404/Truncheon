# <span style="color:red">**Truncheon: A Nion Project**</span>

<marquee>| Project Lamatshu has been cancelled and based on the observations made in Mosaic, Project Truncheon will continue in those footsteps. | Development has been slow, but will not stop. | APIs and Core Programs are being rewritten completely to optimize memory usage and improve performance. So far, it has worked out well. | A new Release may appear in May or June, if possible :) |</marquee>

## Introduction

---

Truncheon iteration is a part of Project Nion, which is aimed to provide a platform to create and deploy modules in a flexible and versatile framework to maximise efficiency of modules and other programs dependent on this project.

This program has powerful tools, APIs and security features which will help the developers to build programs on top of Truncheon and users to work with the programs!

## Features

---

| Feature Name | Details |
| --- | --- |
|**Unified Build System** | This program has all the core code written purely in Java, which means that the same program build can run on Windows&reg;, MacOS&reg; and Linux with ease! With minimal dependency on external code and programs, this program will run on any system that Java is supported on! |
|**Truncheon Kernel** | With the ideas taken in from Mosaic and (the now cancelled Lamatshu), the program has an advanced kernel and core programs which is simple, modular and efficient.Truncheon has its own API to allow people to build programs on top of Truncheon itself! |
|**Dragon API** | APIs related to login and user management system with advanced security features, which can be harnessed by other softwares built on Truncheon. **Stored credentials are not stored in plain text format, which means that the database will be secure against attacks.**|
|**OTA Updates** | This program can receive OTA updates directly from the web over time, including security enhancements and optimizations. The update package is minimally small in size (roughly less than 8 MB), will take less than 2 minutes to install the update. Its all upto the user then: Restart the program right away, else finish the work and then restart/exit. On the next boot, the updated program will be loaded, giving the best experience to the user, always. |
|**Useful Features**| Uses the built in APIs to provide a set of powerful and versatile features to work with, right out of the box. Extra programs can be loaded/downloaded from the internet to enhance the experience and the features offered, but note that not all programs downloaded from the internet (which has not been open sourced) cannot be trusted implicitly as they might be malicious in nature.
|**Program Toolsets**| Truncheon Source code includes tools which will help in compiling the program, documentation and the Launcher, and then running, and debugging it! Although the debugger will not be included, people can write their own Debugger to fulfil the requirements!
